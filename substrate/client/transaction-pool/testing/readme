This is basically a shell/brain-dump of my activities in testing transaction
pool. It is not well organised (apologies). Intended to build something better
from this.

I have different zombienet files, for different scenarios, e.g.:
- one collator,
- 3x collator + 1x rpc node
- limits on transactions pool
- old transaction pool (for comparing behaviour)
- debug levels

Also different runtimes are checked (e.g. yap and asset-hub).

Ther is a `run` bash script that allows to customize PATH and execute zombienet with particular scenario.


Test tool:
I am using this tool for testing scenarios:
https://github.com/michalkucharczyk/tx-test-tool/

`testing-commands` file contains a history dump of different test executions. (Provided for reference).

Test tool 2:
There is also one more tool:
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/

Mainly used by chains team to check the transaction throughput. I think that sending method shall be incorporated into tx-test-tool.
